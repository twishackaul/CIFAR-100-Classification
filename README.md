# CIFAR-100-Classification
#### Developed a simple Artificial Neural Network and a Convolutional Neural Network for CIFAR 100 dataset. Confusion Matrix, Heatmap and Classification Report is used for performance evaluation with performance metrics for training used is Accuracy.
#### This dataset is just like the CIFAR-10, except it has 100 classes containing 600 images each. There are 500 training images and 100 testing images per class. The 100 classes in the CIFAR-100 are grouped into 20 superclasses. Each image comes with a "fine" label (the class to which it belongs) and a "coarse" label (the superclass to which it belongs).
#### Here is the list of classes in the CIFAR-100:

### Superclass	
- aquatic mammals	
- fish	
- flowers	
- food containers	
- fruit and vegetables
